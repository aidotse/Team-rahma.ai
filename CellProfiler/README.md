**Important notice:** The internal evaluation uses [`CellProfiler`](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler). Instead of simply cloning CP from the official repository, we had to fix some issues with the official code, and therefore needed to add CP into the codebase, in folder `CellProfiler/`. CP has their own non-MIT license, however, CP is only needed for the evaluation and this folder `CellProfiler/` can be simply deleted from the codebase.
